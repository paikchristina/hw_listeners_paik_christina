## Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments

We spoke via email about adding the v0.1 tag to the branches created for this assignment but we did not find a working solution to add the tag to branches once they have been created. You asked me to include this part in the comments so that I wouldn't have points deducted. Thank you!
